# Prescribly

## Getting Started

This is a mono-repo that utilizes the full-stack features of NextJS framework. There are a couple of things you need to have already installed on your computer before you can get started:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

Once you have the prerequisites installed, clone this repo onto your computer:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/codeMonkey20/prescribly.git
```

Once that finishes, go to the project's root directory.

```shell
cd prescribly
```

Here, you'll find boilerplate code from NextJS. Below are the steps needed when running for the first time:


### Manual Setup

Install npm dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

Once the dependencies have been installed, start the application with the following command:

```shell
npm run dev
```

The frontend application is now running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Backend application runs at [http://localhost:3000/api](http://localhost:3000/api)
